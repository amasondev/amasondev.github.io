<p>Antlion: Reloaded is a simple top-down game created in Unity for <abbr title="Foundations of Game Design">IAT 312</abbr>. The team was tasked with creating a brand new version of an unsuccessful game called Antlion. What resulted was a fun, hectic puzzle game which succeeded in teaching players without the use of tutorials.</p>
