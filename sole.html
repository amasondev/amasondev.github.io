<p>"Souls of Luminous Eternity" (SOLE) was an online fighting game project I worked on with a team called Accel Games. SOLE was designed around the idea of creating a two-dimensional fighting game without walls on either side of the playing field, thus a circular ring to fight upon.</p>

<p>My role in this project involved creating a networked prototype to allow the designers to play and test their idea. In a period of days we created a working prototype.</p>
