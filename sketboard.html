<p>Sketboard is an online multiplayer skateboard simulator produced for Unreal Engine's <a href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/january-game-jam-theme-back-to-square-one/18508" target="_blank">January Jam</a>. The theme of this jam was "Back to Square One", and so we decided to make a game of trial and error. In 48 hours we produced a <em>somewhat</em> working multiplayer game with ragdoll physics and destructible objects. Hey, it was our first attempt at using Unreal's replication system; it's a miracle it worked at all!</p>

<p>One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was watching people play our game live as we released. After only 48 hours of development and zero testing, watching players join our game and play with us was a delight.</p>
